# Quantum Computation

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is very important in quantum computation. 
Basically we are playing with quantum computation ideas using linear algebra packages.

This includes:
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* QR decomposition
* Eigendecomposition
* Schmidt decomposition and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

Schmidt decomposition is used in **Density Matrix Embedding Theory** (DMET).  
I think the idea of embedding method can be traced originally to the Anderson impurity model.

### Low-rank approximation


### Numpy and SciPy


In practical calculations, NumPy and SciPy are two useful tools for linear algebra. 

For example, we use ```eig```, ```eigh```, and ```eigsh``` in ```numpy``` and ```scipy``` to diagonalize matrix and calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Actually, ```eigh``` is used to treat Hermitian or a real symmetric matrix. The output of ```eigh``` will be **sorted**, while output of ```eig``` will be **unsorted**.

### OpenFermion

OpenFermion has API for Psi4 and PySCF. [Here](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Psi4/blob/master/openfermionpsi4/_psi4_conversion_functions.py) is an example for Psi4 conversion functions,
and [here](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Psi4/blob/master/openfermionpsi4/_psi4_template) is a calculation template for OpenFermion-Psi4.

Here is an [example](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/23801/hartree-fock-state-in-openfermion) on calculate the Hatree-Fock energy using OpenFermion. We note that to calculate the expectation value 
we can use ```@``` for matrix multiplication and ```*``` for element-wise multiplication (follows the convention from ```scipy.sparse```[?](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html)).
I think it depends on ```np.matrix``` or ```np.ndarray```.
In this [page](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/blob/v1.6.0/src/openfermion/linalg/sparse_tools.py#L668-L710) we can see they use ```*``` to calculate the expectation value and variance of an operator.

OpenFermion has some useful functions as follows:

* ```chemist_ordered```: a [function](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/transforms/chemist_ordered)
to transform a two-body fermion operator in chemist ordering[^1]. However, it seems that it cannot be used to generate the two-electron integral tensor $V_{pqrs}$
we want, because it has already _absorbed_ the 8-fold symmetry of $V$. ($W$, which is the flattened $V$, should be a definite matrix?)
* ```get_ground_state```: calculate the ground energy and ground state by exact diagonalization. The input should be a ```LinearOperator``` (sparse operator).
It corresponds to the **full configuration interaction** (FCI) result. Indeed, it is calling the ```eigsh``` function in scipy. [Please check more details of other functions in this source code page.][link-get_ground_state]
* ```get_sparse_operator```: a [function](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/linalg/get_sparse_operator) to transform
an operator to a sparse matrix. The input can be a ```FermionOperator``` or a ```PolynomialTensor```. The output are always a ```QubitOperator```, with the Jordan-Wigner transform used.
* ```PolynomialTensor```: a [class](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/ops/PolynomialTensor) for tensor representations of operators. It has an intrinsic 
[method](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/blob/v1.6.0/src/openfermion/ops/representations/polynomial_tensor.py#L370-L384) for basis rotation as ```rotate_basis```.
Here are some [examples](https://python.hotexamples.com/examples/openfermion.ops/PolynomialTensor/rotate_basis/python-polynomialtensor-rotate_basis-method-examples.html) on how to use ```PolynomialTensor.rotate_basis```.
[Please check here for source code.][link-PolynomialTensor]
* ```InteractionOperator```: a [class](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/ops/InteractionOperator) to define fermionic operator with given ```one_body_tensor``` and ```two_body_tensor```, which later can be used as its attributes.
It has an intrinsic [method](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/ops/general_basis_change) called ```general_basis_change```

By the way, ```FermionOperator``` has an ```is_normal_ordered``` function to check whether terms are in normal order.

### QURI Parts

QURI Parts is a useful package to perform quantum simulation.
They provides a [general tutorial](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/tutorials) on how to use QURI Parts and its modules
such as **Pauli Word Grouping** and quantum chemistry calculations. 

We can use QURI Parts to perform [sampling simulation](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/tutorials/sampling_simulation).
We can also use ```CommutablePauliSetMeasurement```  to perform sampling estimation, with given ```pauli_set```, ```measurement_circuit```, and ```pauli_reconstructor_factory```.
Here are some API reference we may need:

* ```operator```: a [module](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.operator.operator) for operator, as a set of single-term operators using [dict](https://utokyo-ipp.github.io/3/3-1.html).
* ```comp_basis```: a [module](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.state.comp_basis.html) for computational basis state. Binary number is suitable (we can use 7 to represent 0b111?). Superposition is available.
* ```shots_allocator```: a [module](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.sampling.shots_allocator.html) determine how the number of shots distribute among groups.
* ```sampling```: a [package](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.estimator.sampling)
* ```measurement```: a [package](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.measurement)
