# Quantum Computation

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is very important in quantum computation. 
Basically we are playing with quantum computation ideas using linear algebra packages.

This includes:
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* QR decomposition
* Eigendecomposition
* Schmidt decomposition and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

Shimidt decomposition is used in **Density Matrix Embedding Theory** (DMET).  
I think the idea of embedding method can be traced originally to the Anderson impurity model.

In practical calculations, NumPy and SciPy are two useful tools for linear algebra. 

For example, we use ```eig```, ```eigh```, and ```eigsh``` in ```numpy``` and ```scipy``` to diagonalize matrix and calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Actually, ```eigh``` is used to treat Hermitian or a real symmetric matrix. The output of ```eigh``` will be **sorted**, while output of ```eig``` will be **unsorted**.

### Functions

OpenFermion provides a [function](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/transforms/chemist_ordered) called ```chemist_ordered```,
but it seems that it cannot be used to generate the two-electron integral tensor we want,
because it has already _absorbed_ the 8-fold symmetry.

* ```chemist ordered```
* ```get_ground_state```: calculate the ground energy and ground state by exact diagonalization.
It corresponds to the **full configuration interaction** (FCI) result. Indeed, it is calling the ```eigsh``` function in scipy. [Please check more details of other functions in this source code page.][link-get_ground_state]
