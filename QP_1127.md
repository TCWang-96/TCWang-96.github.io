## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is very important in quantum computation. 
Basically we are playing with quantum computation ideas using linear algebra packages.

This includes:
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* QR decomposition
* Eigendecomposition
* Schmidt decomposition and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

Shimidt decomposition is used in **Density Matrix Embedding Theory** (DMET).  
I think the idea of embedding method can be traced originally to the Anderson impurity model.

In practical calculations, NumPy and SciPy are two useful tools for linear algebra.
