# Quantum Computation

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is very important in quantum computation. 
Basically we are playing with quantum computation ideas using linear algebra packages.

This includes:
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* QR decomposition
* Eigendecomposition
* Schmidt decomposition and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

Shimidt decomposition is used in **Density Matrix Embedding Theory** (DMET).  
I think the idea of embedding method can be traced originally to the Anderson impurity model.

In practical calculations, NumPy and SciPy are two useful tools for linear algebra. 

For example, we use ```eig```, ```eigh```, and ```eigsh``` in ```numpy``` and ```scipy``` to diagonalize matrix and calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Actually, ```eigh``` is used to treat Hermitian or a real symmetric matrix. The output of ```eigh``` will be **sorted**, while output of ```eig``` will be **unsorted**.

### OpenFermion

OpenFermion provides functions

* ```chemist ordered```: a [function](https://quantumai.google/reference/python/openfermion/transforms/chemist_ordered)
to transform a two-body fermion operator in chemist ordering. However, it seems that it cannot be used to generate the two-electron integral tensor $V_{ijkl}$
we want, because it has already _absorbed_ the 8-fold symmetry of $V$. ($W$, which is the flattened $V$, should be a definite matrix?)
* ```get_ground_state```: calculate the ground energy and ground state by exact diagonalization.
It corresponds to the **full configuration interaction** (FCI) result. Indeed, it is calling the ```eigsh``` function in scipy. [Please check more details of other functions in this source code page.][link-get_ground_state]

### QURI Parts

QURI Parts is a useful package to perform quantum simulation.
They provides a [general tutorial](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/tutorials) on how to use QURI Parts and its modules
such as **Pauli Word Grouping** and quantum chemistry calculations. 

We can use QURI Parts to perform [sampling simulation](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/tutorials/sampling_simulation).
We can also use ```CommutablePauliSetMeasurement```  to perform sampling estimation, with given ```pauli_set```, ```measurement_circuit```, and ```pauli_reconstructor_factory```.
Here are some API reference we may need:

* ```operator```: a [module](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.operator.operator) for operator, as a set of single-term operators using [dict](https://utokyo-ipp.github.io/3/3-1.html).
* ```comp_basis```: a [module](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.state.comp_basis.html) for computational basis state. Binary number is suitable (we can use 7 to represent 0b111?). Superposition is available.
* ```shots_allocator```: a [module](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.sampling.shots_allocator.html) determine how the number of shots distribute among groups.
* ```sampling```: a [package](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.estimator.sampling)
* ```measurement```: a [package](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/quri_parts/core/quri_parts.core.measurement)
